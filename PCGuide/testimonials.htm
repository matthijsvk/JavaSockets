		<li>&quot;Really, the biggest drawback of <i>The TCP/IP Guide</i> is that my 
		attempts to describe it turn me into a slavering fanboy. My 
		cubicle-mates stare wide-eyed at me and say in calming tones, &quot;Scott ... 
		it's just a book.&quot; But geez, I literally cannot imagine anyone in IT who 
		would not find this book eminently useful. It's a literary &quot;perfect 
		storm&quot; of great research, great organization, appealing prose, 
		appropriate technical illustration, and clear-mindedness. I mean, what 
		else do ya want? If you've read as many bad IT books as I have, you will 
		appreciate the mastery of Kozierok's achievement. His warmth and style 
		don't smack you in the face at first (which is part of why it wears well 
		over 1600 pages); but keep reading, and you'll discover an IT brother. 
		... <i>[The] TCP/IP Guide</i> will be the standard for years to come. 
		You heard it here first.&quot; -- <i>D. Scott Pinzon, CISSP</i>, <i>

		review at WatchGuard Technologies, Inc.</a></i></li>
		<li><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;">&quot;This is one of the 
		most comprehensive references available on the subject of TCP/IP.&nbsp; At 
		over 1,600 pages, author Charles Kozierok succeeds in organizing this 
		involved subject into an introductory section, a general section for 
		application developers, and one for low-level programmers who need 
		detailed access to the protocol.&nbsp; Key concepts are sectioned off in 
		bolded text on a gray background as a visual cue.&nbsp; The many diagrams and 
		illustrations are welcome in helping to explain the most complicated 
		concepts.&nbsp; Kozierok's writing style is engaging and informative, 
		especially in the introductory chapters.</span> ... Now I can retire all 
		my other TCP/IP books I have gathering dust on my bookshelves. Oh, wait, 
		I guess I can keep them as relics from times past and perhaps become 
		collector’s items. No, I looked at Amazon.com and they hold little value 
		today. This book however may become timeless, because it not only talks 
		about, but shows “everything”.&quot; -- <i>Jonathan Hoyle and Robert

		<li>&quot;Charles M. Kozierok's new <i>TCP/IP Guide</i> is the best-organized 
		and easiest-to-digest &quot;complete&quot; TCP/IP book I've ever seen. ... I can't 
		think of a reason why any datacenter or beginning IT technician wouldn't 
		want to own this volume. It's well written and organized, as complete as 
		nearly everyone could want, contains many useful tables and diagrams, 
		and covers IPv6, the forthcoming next generation of Internet 
		technology.&quot; -- <i>Jon Sobel,

		<li>&quot;I'm blown away by this book. The coverage of the topics is 
		outstanding in both it's breadth and depth. The tone is very readable. 
		And the use of graphics, wow. This book is tremendous. It's going to 
		instantly be &quot;the TCP/IP reference&quot;. It blows the old classic, TCP/IP 
		Illustrated, straight out of the water. This book is worth every single 
		penny. No doubt. It's going to set a new bar for technical books. Wow.&quot;

		review at amazon.com</a></i></li>
		<li>&quot;The TCP/IP Guide is a name that doesn't scratch the surface 
		regarding how much thought and work went into this opus work by the 
		author. At over 1,500+ pages, this is a reference, an encyclopedia, and 
		a teaching tool all wrapped up into one. This isn't the kind of text 
		that anyone would just crack open and read in a weekend, but the most 
		experienced of engineers WILL read this book cover to cover and find it 
		an interesting journey to take. An amazing piece of work that will 
		remain and thrive in networking circles for a long, long time to come. &quot;

		<li>&quot;...for the last 10 years I have been an internet service provider

	<p>Here are a few of the many testimonials from people who 
	are reading and using The TCP/IP Guide electronic edition:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>&quot;THANK YOU!!!!! I just had to say that. :) Finally, someone has 
		taken something as complex as the TCP/IP protocol and described it a 
		simple yet thorough manner that I can understand!! I purchased it on 
		Friday and have been reading it all weekend. I started with the section 
		on DNS and have learned more about it in one weekend than I have in my 
		6+ years working with computers. Good work. I am so impressed with it 
		that I have been recommending it to all my co-workers and friends.&quot; -- 
		Jason E., Williamsport, PA</li>
		<li>&quot;I am <i>so</i> delighted to see the next Major Step from this 
		author. This is not
		an idle thought. I have been suggesting PCGuide.com to my students since 
		the
		1990's. This new entry *is critical* to CompTIA Network+ and lower level
		Cisco candidates (CCNA/CCNP, CCDA). I also Strongly Suggest A+ 2003 and
		beyond candidates become avid readers so they are REAL people, not just
		parrots making certification tests happy.&quot; -- <i>
		<a href="http://www.tcat.net">Tcat Houser</a></i>, <i>author and educator</i></li>
		<li>&quot;I have found The TCP/IP Guide to be a surprisingly comprehensive 
		manual on an infinitely huge topic. The Guide offers not only a detailed 
		view of the TCP/IP protocol suite, but also defines networking and the 
		OSI model architecture, in a genuinely interesting and easy to digest 
		manner. Charles' relaxed, personal and humorous writing style makes 
		reading the Guide as enjoyable as a mystery novel. The multiple levels 
		of detail - from simple overture to drilled down deep - makes The TCP/IP 
		Guide a valuable resource for any IT professional as well as an 
		excellent text for students.&quot; -- <i>Mary Richards, MCSE, A+</i></li>
		<li>&quot;Well, Charles Kozierok, creator of <i>
		<a href="http://www.pcguide.com/">The PC Guide</a></i>, has done it 
		again! Written in his familiar down-to-earth style, The TCP/IP Guide is 
		at once easy enough to understand that it should be an excellent 
		starting place for beginners to learn networking -- and at the same 
		time, thorough and in-depth enough to make it a must-have reference for 
		advanced users and professionals.&quot; -- Billy Griffis, computer technician</li>
		<li>&quot;Whenever I bump into troubles that seem even remotely 
		TCP/IP-related, I dig out The TCP/IP Guide. It almost always gives me 
		the answer I seek, and most of the time I keep on reading. The clarity 
		with which complex issues are explained, the omnipresent hyperlinks that 
		allow you to go broad or deep on a given subject, the humorous writing 
		style... It really makes for a captivating read and what's even more 
		important: a lot of the info really sticks in my head. A superb 
		reference work by any standard.&quot; -- <i>Steven, IT student, Belgium</i></li>
		<li>&quot;An absolute must-have for the serious student of networking, and 
		those who just want a greater understanding of the technical world 
		around them. Its level of detail is excellent, yet its simple 
		explanations and analogies of even the most complex subjects make this 
		work unparalleled. Even for the experienced student its coverage of the 
		basics can make things so much clearer.&quot; -- <i>Iain Denton, networking 
		student, Tasmania, Australia</i></li>
		<li>&quot;I've started reading the full 
		guide skimming through each section and so far it's definitely very high 
		quality. The manner in which it's written is very professional and much 
		easier to grasp then most technical books I've read. I love the use of 
		easy to understand analogies, especially relating the host 
		and network portion of an IP address to a telephone number. This guide 
		is a must have for anyone serious about a future in computer networking.&quot; 
		-- <i>Eric Plumstead, networking student; Flemington, NJ</i> </li>
		<li>&quot;What a magnum opus! Well 
		written, assuming little knowledge on the part of the reader, but, 
		unlike many technical works, it is not patronising in tone. I think, if 
		I finish reading it I might actually have learned a lot about 
		networking. And painlessly too!&quot; -- <i>David Eaton, Somerset, England</i></li>
