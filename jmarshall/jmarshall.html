<i><b>November 13, 2014--</b>released CGIProxy
<a href="tools/cgiproxy/">version 2.1.14</a>, which has <b>many</b> bug fixes.
Major sites now work again in all major browsers, and FastCGI support
works again.</i>


<p>I wrote some <a href="/easy/">instant tutorials</a> on CGI, HTML, 
and HTTP to get you up to speed <i>fast</i>.  They're called 
<a href="/easy/cgi/">CGI Made Really Easy</a>, 
<a href="/easy/html/">HTML Made Really Easy</a>, and
<a href="/easy/http/">HTTP Made Really Easy</a>.
If you know what a text file is, you can be writing HTML within an
hour.  If you're a programmer, you can be writing CGI scripts within
an hour.  If you know sockets programming, you can understand HTTP
within an hour.

<p>The <a href="/tools/">Web Tools</a> section has various tools I've
written to help with Web sites.  So far, there's
a <a href="/tools/cgiproxy/">CGI script that acts as an HTTP/FTP proxy</a>
(lets you access otherwise-inaccessible URLs),
a <a href="/tools/dbmedit/">DBM file editor</a>, a multi-featured
<a href="/tools/cl/">link-checker</a>, and a
<a href="/tools/defaultify/">Perl module that lets you pre-fill HTML
form fields</a> according to a hash you give it.  Enjoy!

<p>Check out the <a href="/polisim/">Election Simulator</a>, an
interactive Java applet that models an election of several candidates.
Political positions are mapped into a plane rather than the traditional
"right-wing, left-wing" line.  In automatic mode, candidates alter their
position to maximize their votes.  Among other things, it demonstrates how
a two-party system is fundamentally different from a three or more -party
system, and how three or more parties allow change while two do not.

<p>If you live in the San Francisco Bay Area and you like live music,
ask my <a href="/events/">Live Music in the Bay Area</a> database which
bands are playing where on what nights, within how many miles of your
address.  (Currently, the data comes from Steve Koepke's "The List",
which focuses on "funk-punk-thrash-ska", which may or may not be your
cup of tea.)

<p>
Have fun,<br>
James
